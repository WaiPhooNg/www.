      <p>The best time to go to France is in the summer ( June - August ) where the tempature there is mild and warm and the crowds aren't there. It's really nice to go there since the sun is going to shine a lot and the beaches of Normandy would be a great vacation spot, not only that but the Eiffel Tower won't be covered in fog meaning you can get some scenic and wonderful shots of it!</p>

      <div><img src="image/Nap.jpg"></div>
      <p>Image source : wikipedia</p>
      <p>France is currently an independent and large European nation, France gained their territory and culture through a vast and rich history though, here's a brief summary of it</p>
      <p>In the age of the Romans France was part of the Gaullic territory or Gallia as the natives refered it to. The present name originates from the Latin word Francia, meaning "country of the Franks," a type of Germanic people who conquered the area around the 5th century, at the time of the collaspe of the Western Roman Empire. It later became a separate and independent country around the 9th century.</p>
