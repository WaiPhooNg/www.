      <p>Before the Spanish colonized Mexico there was nothing much in Mexico rather than multiple minor tribal civillizations along with a few advanced ones.</p>
      <p>In 1521, Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes conquered the Aztecs and Mexico became a Spanish colony. For 300 years Spain ruled the land until the early 1800s. At that time the local Mexicans revolted against Spanish rule. Father Miguel Hidalgo declared Mexico's independence with his famous cry of "Viva Mexico".</p>

    <h1>Basic History 2</h1>
    <p>In 1821, Mexico defeated the Spanish and gained full independence. Heroes of the Mexican revolution included General Augustin de Iturbide and General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Following Mexico's independence they went on to have a negative reputation with the United States for a long period in which the rivarly still stands today. Recently though, multiple Mexican cartel armies rose up and began a new war with the Mexican government. Although the war is quite small and well contained Mexico hasn't been the same with the rise of the cartel forces in the last decade.</p>
