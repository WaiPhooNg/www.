      <p>The best time to visit China is in Spring or Autumn where the weather is warm and pleasant and most of the tourists and visitors aren't here. During this period most of the landmarks and historical sites are not crowded meaning that you can enjoy a more private time when visiting landmarks and historical sites. Another thing we advise you to do when visiting China is that you should visit the various shrines and temples around China as meditating or praying there is often said to give you good luck.</p>

      <p>China was ruled by various dynasties much of its history. The first dynasty is believed to be the Xia dynasty which formed somewhere around 2250 BC. The Shang or Yin dynasty gained power around the 14th century BC. The Han Dynasty, which lasted over 400 years from 206 BC to 220 AD, was one of the most influential in China's history. Much of the culture today was created during the Han Dynasty. Later famous dynasties, like the Song and the Tang, continued to refine the culture and their government that ruled over 100 million people.</p>
