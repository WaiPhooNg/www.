      <div><img src="image/carthago.jpg"></div>
      <p>Image source : Wikipedia.com</p>
      <p>A small agricultural village was growing on the west coast of Italy around the same time in the 8th century BCE. It established the city of Rome, which grew to become Ancient Rome, one of the world's major civilizations. The Roman Republic would emerge first, followed by the Roman Empire. Much of Europe and the Mediterranean would be under its control. Much of today's western civilisation, including philosophy, art, and law, would be shaped by the influence of Rome and Greek culture. The Roman Empire was split into two parts in 395 CE: the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. The Western Empire, which lasted until 476 CE, included Italy.</p>
