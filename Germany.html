      <p>France is currently an independent and large European nation, France gained their territory and culture through a vast and rich history though, here's a brief summary of it</p>
      <p>In the age of the Romans France was part of the Gaullic territory or Gallia as the natives refered it to. The present name originates from the Latin word Francia, meaning "country of the Franks," a type of Germanic people who conquered the area around the 5th century, at the time of the collaspe of the Western Roman Empire. It later became a separate and independent country around the 9th century.</p>
